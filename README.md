# GitPunk Analyst

**GitPunk Analyst** is a Cyberpunk-themed GitHub profile analyzer that turns developer stats into a futuristic "Hacker Score". It scans public GitHub profiles, visualizes data with neon-soaked charts, and uses Google's Gemini AI to generate a witty, recruiter-style "Insight Report" based on the user's coding habits.

 ✨ **100% AI-Generated Code**
> **Note:** This entire application—including all logic, UI design, styling, and documentation—was written exclusively by **Google Gemini**, with no manual coding by human developers.
